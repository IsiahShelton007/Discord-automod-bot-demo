# Discord-automod-bot-demo

## This is super simple to run just make sure you do pip install discord.
## You also have to make sure you make a file titled token.py in the same directory as bot.py in the token file make a new token varuable and set it = to your discord bot token you got from the discord dev portal.

## This will curnetly only sort bad words but you could add mroe fetures later.
